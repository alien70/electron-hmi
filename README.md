# electron-hmi
Demonstration project to explore the possibilities offered by multiplatform technologies such as node.js, typescript and electron, in **H**uman **M**achine **I**nterfaces (HMI) development.

As an engineer involved in the last two decades in design and development of complex systems in the fields of Industrial Automation, Internet Of Things, and lately in Virtual/Augmented Reality aided Training Systems, 
one of the tasks to face with is the development of different HMI clients to allow the interaction between the end user and the above mentioned systems.

This note, and the attached project, is aimed to identify a set of technologies that will allow the realization of those interfaces independently, as far as possible, from the hardware platform on which they are intended to run.
